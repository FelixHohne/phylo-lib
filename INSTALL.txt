We don't have any external dependencies. 
Note:  We have primarily tested on Mac OS. For the optimal experience, please 
use a Mac. We can't guarantee that the formatting will look perfect on all 
other systems.

First, run 'make'. This builds the system and imports all the needed modules
into utop. You can see the modules imported in .ocamlinit.

MS1 DEMO BELOW:
The functionality we would like to demo right now is:
1) XML parser for phylogenetic trees stored in the phyloXML format
2) ASCII pretty-printer for the phylogenetic trees
3) The Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for pairwise alignment of DNA sequences. 

Below, we have included demo code that you can run in utop to see each of these 
features.
While we have implemented additional functionality, it is not yet 
ready to be demoed.

Running the XML Parser:
- We parse an amphibian species phyloXML file found in the Phylo folder 
  called frog.xml into our custom built n-ary tree, then pretty-print it 
  using ASCII art.

let phylo1 = Phylo_parser.from_phylo "PhyloXML/frog.xml";;
Tree.print_tree phylo1.tree;;

let phylo2 = Phylo_parser.from_phylo "PhyloXML/collapsed_tree.xml";;
Tree.print_tree phylo2.tree;;


Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm: 
- Needleman-Wunsch is a globally optimal algorithm for finding the pairwise 
alignment of two strings. Here we implement it to find the optimal alignment 
of two pairs of DNA sequences. We read in the sequences two ways through the 
Dna module - from a string and from a .FASTA file.

let dna1 = Dna.from_string "AATCGTAGGCCCC";; 
let dna2 = Dna.from_string "ATTGCGACTCGTATC";; 
let arr = Pairwise.align_pair dna1 dna2 1 (-1) (-1);;
Dna.to_string arr.(0);;
Dna.to_string arr.(1);;

let dna3 = Dna.from_fasta "FASTA/install_dna1.fasta";; 
let dna4 = Dna.from_fasta "FASTA/install_dna2.fasta";; 
let arr2 = Pairwise.align_pair dna3 dna4 1 (-1) (-1);;
Dna.to_string arr2.(0);;
Dna.to_string arr2.(1);;

Note: According to the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm, there may be multiple 
different pairwise alignments that are equally optimal. The specific sequence
we return is an implementation detail. 

In case you want to test these features out with more files, we also have 
"PhyloXML/tol_156.xml" to use with the xml parser, and the .FASTA files in the 
FASTA folder to use as DNA sequences. Some .FASTA may be quite long and might 
take time to perform an alignment on.

MS2 BELOW: 

We would like to demonstrate our final phylogenetic tree construction 
functionality here. We read in DNA sequences from different species, create a 
distance matrix for them, and use the UPGMA algorithm to construct a most 
likely phylogenetic tree based on the distance matrix.

First, we construct a phylogenetic tree for the H1N1, H5N1, and H3N2 viruses 
sing their PB-2 gene data. The resulting tree shows that H1N1 and H3N2 are more 
closely related, which makes sense since they are swine flus while H5N1 is an 
avian flu.

let d1 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h5n1.fasta";;
let d2 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h1n1.fasta";;
let d3 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h3n2.fasta";;
let mat = Distance.dist_dna [| d1; d2; d3 |] 1 (-1) (-1);;
Phylo_algo.upgma mat [|"H5N1"; "H1N1"; "H3N2"|] |> Tree.print_tree;;

Compared to the outgroup ebola, H5N1 and H1N1 are more closely related, and our
resulting tree demonstrates that.

let d1 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h5n1.fasta";;
let d2 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h1n1.fasta";;
let d3 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/ebola.fasta";;
let mat = Distance.dist_dna [| d1; d2; d3 |] 1 (-1) (-1);;
Phylo_algo.upgma mat [|"H5N1"; "H1N1"; "Ebola"|] |> Tree.print_tree;;


let d1 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h5n1.fasta";;
let d2 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h1n1.fasta";;
let d3 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h7n7.fasta";;
let d4 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h7n9.fasta";;
let d5 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/h3n2.fasta";;
let d6 = Dna.from_fasta "viruses/ebola.fasta";;
let mat = Distance.dist_dna [| d1; d2; d3; d4; d5; d6 |] 1 (-1) (-2);;
let virus_names = [|"H5N1"; "H1N1"; "H7N7"; "H7N9"; "H3N2"; "Ebola"|];;
(Phylo_algo.upgma mat virus_names) |> Tree.print_tree;;
