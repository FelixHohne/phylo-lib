### What are phylogenetic trees?

Scientists often wish to infer evolutionary history between different organisms.
In order to determine the closeness of species such as birds or fish, 
historically the similarity in physical characteristics was analyzed. 
With the advent of modern computers and DNA analysis, the field has moved 
towards using DNA. 

Two species with more similar DNA are assumed to be more closely related. By 
analyzing these similarities and differences in the DNA, we can generate a 
hypothetical evolutionary tree, called a phylogenetic tree, that estimates, to 
the best of our ability, what the actual historical evolutionary tree would have 
looked like.
